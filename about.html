        Who Are We?
    </h1>
    <div class="centre2">
        We are a non-profit British organisation operating out of the heart of England, built around the core idea of strengthening relations between The UK and Romania in the ever trying times.
        <br>
        <br>
            Our determination to achieve and willingness to do anything available at our disposal has allowed us to swiftly, and efficiently, 
            propel ourselves towards togetherness at a rate many claimed was nigh impossible. And like always, we proved those naysayers wrong by 
            bringing both nations closer than ever before under one shared goal: harmony and balance between two incredibly diverse, important, and beautiful nations.
        <br>
        <br>
        The organisation originally started as a small passion project of a small group of like-minded individuals, headed by our current CEO, Mark Sylvian, whom has lead this company ever since. 
        Beginning in a small, run down Midlands office building in an unsurprisingly funding-starved city, the Anglo-Romanian Friendship League barrelled head first into the unknown, not knowing 
        if it would survive to see the next day. Graciously, anonymous donors donated to and sponsored our efforts, allowing us to do things we had only dreamt of. From there, we expanded into 
        Bucharest where, to our amazement, recieved instant and unwavering support. Which leads us to now, where our objectives have only expanded, broadened, and eclipsed what we thought would 
        never be possible for us to accomplish, and it's all thanks to people like you. If you wish to support this movement please consider throwing some change our way, we would really appreciate 
        anything you can offer!
